## File Database 1.7.1

Welcome to File Database 1.7.1, Now Better Than Ever! Just like Excel and Google Sheets, You can create multiple databases and have
unlimited fields to add your data! Unlike 1.6 versions however, this doesn't have a GUI just yet. When 1.7.2 is released, It may have 
a GUI. Building this may be very difficult. Because you have multiple fields and not a static amount (just like previous versions), it
may be hard accomodate all the entry boxes to display all the information at once. If any of you would like to help, DM me on Discord or
on my GitHub Page (Issues)!
